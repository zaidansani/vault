# Lurking and Confounding Variables

> [!info] Lurking variable
> Unobserved - that influences the association between the variables of primary interest.

> [!info] Confounding variable
> When two explanatory variables are associated with a response variable, but are also associated with each other.

| Not measured in the study; has a potential for confounding | A variable that is included in the dataset. |

# Types of Studies

> [!info] Observational study
> Values of response variable and explanatory variables are observed for sampled subjects, without anything being done to them.

---

> [!info] Experimental study
> Conducted by assigning subjects to certain experimental conditions and observing outcome on the response variable.

Experimental studies are:
- **advantage**: control for lurking variables by randomly assigning the treatment
- **disadvantage**: time needed is quite long

Elements for a good experimental study are:
- having a control comparison group
- **randomisation**: randomly assigning treatments to subject
- **blinding study**: subjects do not know they receive actual treatment or a placebo

# Sample Survey

1. Identify the population
2. Compile a list of subjects in the population from which the sample will be taken
3. Specify sampling method
4. Collect data from chosen sample

## Sampling Design

- by convenience
	- not representative of population
- by chance
	- randomisation allows for **better representation** of population

## Simple Random Sampling

> [!note] Simple Random Sample
> A simple random sample of $n$ subjects from a sampling frame is one in which each possible sample of size $n$ has the same chance of being selected.

1. Number subjects
2. Generate a set of $n$ random numbers
3. Select the subjects with the index in the set of $n$ random numbers to be the simple random sample.

> [!info] Other ways of sampling design
> - cluster random sampling
> - stratified random sampling

# Data Collection from a Sample

- personal **face-to-face interview**
	- easier to get people to respond
	- costly
- **telephone** interview
	- cheaper
	- easier for refusal
- **self-administered questionnaire**
	- cheapest and least labor-intensive
	- easiest for failing of participate

## Bias

> [!info] Sampling bias
> A bias introduced due to **sampling design steps**.
> - when sample is not random
> - the sampling frame does not represent the full population

> [!info] Sampling bias
> A bias introduced not due to **sampling design steps**.
> - *non-response bias*: some sampled subjects refuse to participate or cannot be reached
> - _response bias_: participants not honest when answering question/answering wrongly
