> [!summary] The following are useful resources that I've used in NUS. 

# Module Planning

- [NUSmods](https://nusmods.com/timetable/sem-2) 
	- for timetable planning, as well as module information. 
	- mod reviews are also pretty useful in my opinion.
- [CourseRekt](https://courserekt.vercel.app/) 
	- to check general demand of a module before CourseReg
- [zai's modplan template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K3Uwi-M5q3lUXoWpmeIonP6WZ_Nedx9rc3auVxN--cQ/edit?usp=drive_link)
	- my Google Sheets template for modplanning. should be helpful regardless of your major, but your mileage might vary!
