>[!summary] Modelling a _HAS-A_ relationship

Composition can be used to **build up layers** of abstractions, to model the **HAS-A** relationship.

> [!example] Consider a circle. A circle contains a center point - which could be modelled as a class by itself. Thus, the circle is composed of a point which represents its center.
