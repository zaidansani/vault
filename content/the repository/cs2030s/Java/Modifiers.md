# `public` & `private`

The `private` keyword should be used on fields/methods that should not be exposed to the environment outside the containing class.

# `final`

This keyword can be used:
* in a class declaration to prevent inheritance
* in a method declaration to prevent overriding
* in a field declaration to prevent re-assignment.

# `static`

This keyword allows an association of the field, or method, to its containing class, instead of a specific instance of the class.

# `abstract`

This keyword can be used to declare a method without implementing anything within the parent class. It also can be used to declare an [abstract class](Abstract%20Class%20&%20Interfaces.md).
