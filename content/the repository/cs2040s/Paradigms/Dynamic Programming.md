1. Optimal sub-structure
   - Optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions to smaller sub-problems.
2. Overlapping sub-problems

# Approaches

## Bottom-down
1. Solve smallest problem
2. Combine smaller problems.
3. Repeat
4. Solve root problem
## Top-down
1. Start at root and recurse
2. Solve and memoize.

# General Strategy
1. Identify optimal substructure
2. Define sub-problems
3. Solve problems using sub-problems
