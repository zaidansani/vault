# DAG SSSP

This algorithm
- does a [topological sort](Topological%20Sorting.md) on the graph, while relaxing the edges.
- now, in topological order, each vertex is processed.

This works for DAGs because of the property that at vertex `v`, all the **shortest paths to all its parents** have been found.
