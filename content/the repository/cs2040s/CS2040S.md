> [!summary] 
> This course introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The course covers basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms.

> [!caution] Prerequisites
> - CS1010 or its variants
> - CS1231 or its variants
