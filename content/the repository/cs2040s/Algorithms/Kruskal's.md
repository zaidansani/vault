Utilises the [Red-Blue Rule](Red-Blue%20Rule.md) on the edges.

1. Sort edges by smallest to biggest $O(ElogE) = O(ElogV)$
2. If the edge does not introduce a cycle, add it into the MST. 
	1. Use union-find $O(logV)$ or $O(\alpha(n))$ operations.

$$ O(ElogV)$$

# Proof of Correctness
1. Each added edge crosses a cut
2. Each edge is lightest edge across cut, all other edges across cut has been considered.
