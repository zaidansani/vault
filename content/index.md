hi, my name is m. zaidan, i'm a first year undergraduate student in the national university of singapore studying computer science, with a minor in statistics.

i am planning on housing my notes here and any other things that might be relevant to my academic journey.

hoping this would be helpful for anyone who has the opportunity to chance onto it!
